## About Iceman fork/repo

The [Iceman fork/repo](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) has more powerful functions like offline sniff. These guys even developed a new hardware called Proxmark3 RDV4 with smart card support. But the official repo and the Iceman repo is not fully compatible. This GUI was designed for only official repo at first, but I'm trying to make it compatible with Iceman repo.
Supported functions when using Iceman client:
+ Command Line
+ Mifare Card info
+ Mifare Check default keys
+ Mifare Nested Attack
+ Mifare Read/Write
